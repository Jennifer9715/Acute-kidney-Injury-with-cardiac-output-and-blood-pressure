This project is for the thesis "Engineering a Large Matched MIMIC-III ICU Waveform Dataset with Clinical Covariates to Determine the Association Between Hemodynamic Variables and Acute Kidney Injury" written by Xiaofei Qu. 

This project is to manage the MIMIC-III dataset to engineer the waveform cohort to conduct time series observational research related to AKI. The code that were used to analyze the data and used to generate the tables and statistics that were included in the thesis were upload to this github.
